### Concept 

https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/

This Python code defines a solution to the "Add Two Numbers" problem using linked lists. The problem statement typically involves adding two numbers represented by linked lists, where each node in the linked list contains a single digit. The linked lists are assumed to be in reverse order, meaning the ones digit is at the head of the list.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. `class ListNode`: This class represents a node in a linked list. Each node has a `val` attribute to store the digit, and a `next` attribute to point to the next node in the list.

2. `__init__(self, x)`: The constructor initializes a `ListNode` object with a given value `x` and sets `next` to `None`.

3. `class Solution`: This class contains the solution to the problem.

4. `__init__(self)`: The constructor for the `Solution` class. It doesn't do anything specific in this case.

5. `addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode`: This method takes two linked lists (`l1` and `l2`) representing two numbers and returns a new linked list representing their sum.

   - `left` is a variable initialized to 0, representing the carry value.
   - `dummy` is a dummy node to simplify the code. `cur` is a reference to the current node, initially set to the dummy node.

6. `while l1 or l2 or left:`: This loop continues until both input linked lists (`l1` and `l2`) and the carry (`left`) are exhausted.

7. `left, sm = divmod(sum(l and l.val or 0 for l in (l1, l2)) + left, 10)`: This line calculates the sum of the current digits and the carry (`left`). The `divmod` function returns the quotient and remainder of the division. The quotient (`left`) becomes the new carry, and the remainder (`sm`) is the digit to be added to the result.

8. `cur.next = cur = ListNode(sm)`: This line creates a new node with the value `sm` and adds it to the result linked list.

9. `l1 = l1 and l1.next`, `l2 = l2 and l2.next`: These lines move to the next nodes in the input linked lists.

10. `return dummy.next`: The result is the next node of the dummy node, which is the head of the resulting linked list.

In summary, the `addTwoNumbers` method simulates the process of adding two numbers represented by linked lists, taking care of carrying values. The dummy node is used to simplify the code and provide a reference to the head of the resulting linked list.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `addTwoNumbers` method is O(max(N, M)), where N and M are the lengths of the input linked lists `l1` and `l2`, respectively.

Here's the breakdown of the time complexity:

1. The loop iterates through the linked lists until both lists and the carry (`left`) are exhausted. The number of iterations is determined by the longer of the two input linked lists.

2. In each iteration, constant time operations are performed, such as summing the current digits, updating the carry, and creating a new node.

3. The sum of the digits in each iteration involves traversing the linked lists, but the traversal is performed only once for each node.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is determined by the length of the longer linked list, making it O(max(N, M)).


### Space Complexity 

The space complexity of the `addTwoNumbers` method is O(max(N, M)), where N and M are the lengths of the input linked lists `l1` and `l2`, respectively.

Here's why:

1. The primary space usage comes from the creation of the new linked list to represent the sum. The number of nodes in the resulting linked list is determined by the length of the longer of the two input linked lists (`l1` and `l2`).

2. Additionally, the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables such as `left`, `sm`, `dummy`, and `cur`, which do not depend on the input size.

Therefore, the dominant factor affecting space complexity is the length of the resulting linked list, and the space complexity is O(max(N, M)).
