## 1 - Two Sum 



### Logic 

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

This Python code defines a function called `twoSum` that takes three parameters: `self`, `nums`, and `target`. The function is designed to find two numbers in the input list (`nums`) whose sum equals the given `target`. The function uses a hash table to efficiently store and retrieve information about the elements in the input list.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. `nums_hash = {}`: This line initializes an empty dictionary called `nums_hash`. This dictionary will be used as a hash table to store elements from the `nums` list along with their indices.

2. `for i in range(len(nums)):`: This line starts a loop that iterates through each index `i` of the `nums` list.

3. `if target - nums[i] in nums_hash:`: Inside the loop, this line checks if the complement of the current element (`target - nums[i]`) is already present in the `nums_hash` dictionary. In other words, it checks if there is a previously encountered element in the list such that adding it to the current element would result in the target sum.

4. `return [nums_hash[target - nums[i]], i]`: If the complement is found in `nums_hash`, the function immediately returns a list containing the indices of the two elements whose sum is equal to the target. The first index is retrieved from `nums_hash[target - nums[i]]`, and the second index is `i`.

5. `nums_hash[nums[i]] = i`: If the complement is not found, the current element (`nums[i]`) along with its index (`i`) is added to the `nums_hash` dictionary. This step ensures that the function keeps track of the elements it has encountered so far.

The overall idea of the function is to efficiently find a pair of indices in the `nums` list such that the corresponding elements add up to the given `target`. It does so by using a hash table to store previously encountered elements and their indices, allowing for constant time lookup of the complement during each iteration of the loop.


### Time Complexity 

The time complexity of the given `twoSum` function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `nums` list. Here's the breakdown of the time complexity:

1. The function iterates through each element in the `nums` list once using a for loop. This takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the list.

2. Inside the loop, the key operation is the dictionary look-up: `if target - nums[i] in nums_hash:`. Dictionary look-up in Python has an average time complexity of O(1). This is because dictionaries in Python are implemented as hash tables, and on average, the time complexity of a successful look-up is constant.

3. The loop body also includes updating the dictionary with `nums_hash[nums[i]] = i`, which is also an O(1) operation on average.

Since the dominant factor affecting the overall time complexity is the loop that iterates through each element in the list, and the operations inside the loop are O(1) on average, the overall time complexity of the `twoSum` function is O(n).

### Space Complexity 

The space complexity of the `twoSum` function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `nums` list. Here's an explanation of the space complexity:

1. `nums_hash = {}`: This line initializes an empty dictionary (`nums_hash`). In the worst case, every element from the `nums` list could be stored in this dictionary, resulting in a space usage proportional to the number of elements in `nums`. Therefore, the space complexity for storing the dictionary is O(n).

2. The function uses a constant amount of additional space for variables like `i`, `target`, etc., which do not depend on the size of the input list. Therefore, they do not contribute to the overall space complexity in terms of the input size.

In summary, the dominating factor in the space complexity is the dictionary (`nums_hash`), and as a result, the space complexity of the `twoSum` function is O(n) due to the storage requirements for the dictionary proportional to the number of elements in the `nums` list.
